# Warewolf - IT2810 - Project 4

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 1.4.9.'

## What is Warewolf?
For project 4, our task was to develop an app that handles some kind of search in a real database. The way we chose to solve this task was by implementing an online grocery catalog for a fictional grocery store. It's purpose is to help customers browse through the different products (or wares, get it?) that are available in the store. Warewolf also supports the eployees by letting them add new products as they "arrive at the store". 

## How we have solved the tasks
(The tasks are reffered to in the order they appear in the project description on BlackBoard)

Task 1:
Warewolf is running on our virtual machine (See website link in the "Run Warewolf" section), is using node.js as the server for handling api calls, and is using Angular 4 on the frontend for handling the user interface. See the section "The Tools we used" for more information.

On the backend, we have used:
- JWT (JSON Web Tokens):
- json body-parser: 
- TODO: FILL IN

For testing, we used:
- Proctractor
- Jasmine

## Run Warewolf
A fully functional version of the application is hostet here: http://it2810-13.idi.ntnu.no:8083/. 
(NB! You need to connect to the NTNU VPN if you are not at NTNU)

However, if you would like to download the project files and run it locally you are free to do so!

Clone the repo to a desired location on your computer.
```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/IT2810/it2810-webutvikling-h17-prosjekt-4-group-13-1.git
```
Enter the "Website" folder and run "npm install" to get all the dependencies.
```bash
$ cd Website
$ npm install
```
Once that is done, you may run our custom npm command "npm run server"

```bash
$ npm run server
```

The page is now available at localhost:8083. Visit this page in your web browser.

```bash
Running on localhost:8083
```

## Run Tests
We have written tests for our software which you may run if you like.

### Running unit tests

TODO: HVORDAN GJÃ˜RES DETTE?

### Running end-to-end tests

If you haven't already, clone the git repo to a desired location. In your terminal, locate the folder called "Website" and run "npm install" to get all the required dependencies.

Then run the following commands. Be sure that one finished before you run the next one.
```batch 
$ ng build
$ node server
```
This terminal will now say "Running on localhost:8083".
Open a new terminal while the server is running and type the last command
```batch 
$ ng e2e --no-serve
```
The end-to-end tests will now execute.

tests via [Protractor](http://www.protractortest.org/).

## What can Warewolf do?
Warewolf has four different roles:
- Admin
- Employee
- Customer
- CEO

Admin, CEO and Customer all have the same rights; Execute searches, create a user and sign in, view their profile and search history.

The Employee can in addition add new products to the database.

### Search:
Once you arrive at the page, you will imidiately see the search page. Even though you don't have a user yet, you can still search, but your history won't be saved. To search, click the big button with an magnifying on it.

- Click the big, turquoise button with an magnifying on it.

Congratulations! You just did your first search using Warewolf! Doing this will show all the products currently in the database, each displaying a product name, the products producer and if it is currently in stock or not. If you click on one of the products, and accordion with additional information is displayed.

Next to the big search button is the text "Show advanced settings". If you click on it, more searching options will become available. Try the different options and see if you can find any interesting products!

- Click "Show advanced settings"
- Try searching for "Banan"
- Try finding all products by "Bama"
- Try finding all products cheaper than 20kr

In order to get a product to be added to your history, you have to click on the results displayed in the list and view the extended information. Come back to this step once you have created a user to try this out!

You might also notice that underneath the list of results, there is some text saying "Display word cloud of results". If you click the text, a modal will open with a word cloud displaying the raito between the quantity of each product currently available. The word cloud will only display the products that is a result of your search.

- Click on the search button without any spesifications
- Click "Display word cloud of results" underneath the results 

NB! If your search gives only one result, you cannot display the word cloud.

### Register:

It's time to make your personal account. Click on "Sign in" in the upper right corner. This will send you to the login page. Here you will, beneath the form, see a "Register" button. Click it and you will now be at the register page.

Fill in your name, your email adresss as the username (this will be validated), select "Customer" as your role and type in a password. Don't worry, your password will be encrypted so even the admins cannot see your password in the database.

- Fill in your personal information as instructed
- Click the "Register" button

If everything went well, you will now be logged in to your Warewolf account! You can sign out by clicking on the exit icon next to your profile information in the upper right corner.

- Sign out by clicking the exit button in the upper right corner

### Sign in:

Once you have signed out, you can now click the "Sign in" button in the upper right corner again. Try to login to the account you created earlier.

Don't want to create an account? Use our testuser: 

username: <b>customer@test.com</b>
password: <b>123456</b>

- Click on the "Sign in" button in the upper right corner
- Fill in your username (email) and password
- Click "Log in"

### View profile:

Now it's time to view your profile. Once logged in, click on the button where some of your profile information is displayed. The button is in the upper right corner, where the sign in button used to be.

- Click on the button with your profile information

You now find yourself on your profile page where you can view statistics for your recently viewed products. As mentioned earlier, you have to view the extended information of the products you search for in order for them to appear on your profile page. Try doing a couple of searches, view some products and come back to your profile page to see the statistics.

- Click on the "Search" button in the upper left corner to get back to the search page.
- Do an empty search by simply clicking the magnifying glass button
- Click on some of the products that appear to view them
- Go back to your profile and view the statistics

### Add new product (Employee only):

Some functionality is exclusively available for the employees and that is to add a product to the database. You can only create Admin, CEO and Employee users if you have a secret password given to you by your manager. This password will remain a secret, but you can use our test employee to see what it looks like:

username: <b>employee@test.com</b>
password: <b>123456</b>

Once you log in as an employee, you will see a new button not previously visible. It's called "Add new" and lies just beneath the big search button. If you click it, a new section will become visible where you can gradully fill in the spesifications of a new product.

The quantity and the stock status of new products will be respectively 0 and out of stock by deafault, because these parameters are theoretically being updated from another system. In this demo, they will remain 0 and out of stock.

If you added a new product, try searching for it!
